            I am a software engineer with diverse experience, eager to learn and
            expand my skillset continuously. I have experience in multiple
            programming languages and I am seeking opportunities to grow and
            specialize in frontend development. My goal is to leverage my skills
            and expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and other
            technologies to create user-friendly and responsive web applications
